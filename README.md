# Blockchain-Enabled Disaster-Resistant Record Storage

## Overview

This system leverages blockchain technology to create a disaster-resistant storage solution for essential records and documents. By distributing encrypted data across a decentralized network, it ensures that critical information remains accessible and verifiable even in the aftermath of catastrophic events. The platform provides individuals, organizations, and governments with a resilient infrastructure for preserving important documents that might otherwise be lost during natural disasters, conflicts, or other emergencies.

## System Architecture

The system consists of four core smart contracts working in harmony:

1. **Document Registration Contract**: Securely stores and indexes essential records with encrypted content
2. **Distributed Backup Contract**: Ensures redundancy by managing storage across multiple geographical locations
3. **Access Recovery Contract**: Provides emergency access protocols for authorized retrieval after disasters
4. **Integrity Verification Contract**: Confirms documents remain unaltered through cryptographic proofs

## Key Features

- **Disaster Resilience**: Records remain accessible even when traditional infrastructure fails
- **Cryptographic Security**: Strong encryption protects sensitive information
- **Geographical Distribution**: Data redundancy across multiple locations prevents regional failures
- **Immutable Record-Keeping**: Blockchain verification prevents tampering or falsification
- **Emergency Access Protocols**: Authorized recovery mechanisms for disaster scenarios
- **Selective Disclosure**: Share specific documents or credentials without revealing entire records
- **Offline Verification**: Cryptographic proofs work even without internet connectivity
- **Decentralized Authority**: No single point of failure in the verification process

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16.0+)
- Truffle Suite or Hardhat
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet
- Access to target blockchain network (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)
- IPFS client (for distributed storage)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/disaster-resistant-storage.git
   cd disaster-resistant-storage
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your specific configuration
   ```

4. Compile smart contracts:
   ```
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

5. Deploy contracts to your chosen network:
   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network [network_name]
   ```

## Smart Contract Details

### Document Registration Contract

Manages the secure storage and indexing of essential records:
- Document registration with metadata
- Encryption of sensitive content
- Access control permissions
- Digital signature verification
- Document classification and tagging
- Expiration and renewal processes
- Fee management for storage costs

### Distributed Backup Contract

Ensures data redundancy across the network:
- Sharding of encrypted documents
- Geographical distribution algorithms
- Storage node incentive mechanisms
- Redundancy level management
- Automated replication protocols
- Storage health monitoring
- Recovery point objectives (RPO) tracking

### Access Recovery Contract

Provides emergency access mechanisms:
- Multi-signature authorization
- Time-locked recovery protocols
- Disaster-specific access conditions
- Trusted recovery agents
- Biometric verification options
- Dead man's switch functionality
- Hierarchical access privileges

### Integrity Verification Contract

Confirms the authenticity and integrity of documents:
- Cryptographic hash verification
- Blockchain-anchored timestamps
- Zero-knowledge proofs for verification
- Audit trail of document access
- Tamper evidence reporting
- Chain of custody tracking
- Compliance certification

## Usage Guidelines

### For Individual Users

1. Register an account and set up recovery options
2. Upload important documents (IDs, certificates, medical records, etc.)
3. Configure access permissions and emergency contacts
4. Create verifiable backup certificates
5. Test recovery procedures periodically
6. Access documents securely from any location

### For Organizations

1. Establish organizational vault with hierarchical access
2. Bulk upload critical business documents
3. Configure department-specific access controls
4. Set up automated backup schedules
5. Establish disaster recovery protocols
6. Integrate with existing document management systems
7. Conduct regular recovery drills

### For Government Agencies

1. Create secure repositories for citizen records
2. Establish verification protocols for official documents
3. Configure cross-agency access permissions
4. Implement distributed backup across secure facilities
5. Develop emergency response integrations
6. Provide citizen access portals for personal records
7. Ensure compliance with data protection regulations

## API Documentation

The platform provides RESTful APIs for application integration:

- `POST /api/documents`: Register a new document
- `GET /api/documents/{id}`: Retrieve document metadata
- `PUT /api/documents/{id}/access`: Update access permissions
- `POST /api/recovery/initiate`: Begin recovery process
- `GET /api/verification/{documentId}`: Verify document integrity
- `POST /api/backup/status`: Check backup distribution status
- `GET /api/audit/{documentId}`: Retrieve access audit trail

## Security Considerations

- All documents are encrypted client-side before storage
- Private keys remain with users and are never transmitted
- Multi-factor authentication for all access requests
- Zero-knowledge proofs allow verification without revealing content
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Compliance with international data protection standards
- Decentralized storage prevents single points of failure

## Disaster Recovery Protocols

1. **Standard Recovery**: Access through normal authentication
2. **Emergency Recovery**: Activated during declared disasters
3. **Deadman Recovery**: Triggered after predefined inactivity period
4. **Authorized Agent Recovery**: Initiated by legally designated representatives
5. **Mass Recovery**: Coordinated retrieval during large-scale disasters

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with national ID systems
- Satellite-based mesh network for truly off-grid access
- AI-powered document classification and prioritization
- Quantum-resistant cryptography implementation
- Enhanced biometric verification options
- Mobile emergency access application
- Cross-border document verification standards
